# Machine Learning From Scratch
Educational project implementing fundamental machine learning and regression algorithms in C++ without relying on external ML libraries.

## Goals

- **Educational**: Understand the math and logic behind each algorithm
- **Performance**: Leverage C++ for efficient computation
- **No Dependencies**: Pure C++ implementation (STL only)
