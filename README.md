# Machine Learning From Scratch
Educational project implementing fundamental machine learning and regression algorithms in C++ without relying on external ML libraries.

## I - Linear Algebra
Before implementing ML and regression algorithms, we need fundamental linear algebra operations and functions. It's the core of the optimization process to get better performances, so we'll try 5 different approachs to compare: 


For further details, see [**I - Linear Algebra**](docs/I_linalg.md)

## II - Linear Algebra Benchmark
Comparison between backends using Google Benchmark across 4 operations
